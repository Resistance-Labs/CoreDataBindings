# Core Data Bindings with NSTableView and ArrayController

This source code is an application that has a simple Contact List. It uses Core Data to store data. Using an Array Controller, a NSTableView displays the list and two buttons allow for adding and removing contacts. 

This is all done without writing a single line of code. It demonstrates the power of Cocoa Bindings. You can read more about this at http://resistancelabs.com/cocoa-bindings-with-nsarraycontroller-nstableview-core-data-and-swift-2-0-on-mac-os-x/
